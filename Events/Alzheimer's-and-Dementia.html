              <p>Alzheimer's is a progressive disease of the brain which causes impairment in memory and cognitive
                function. Alzheimer’s has no exact cause, although aging, genetics, and lifestyle are important risk
                factors, and there is no cure as of now. Symptoms include mental decline, delusion, disorientation,
                forgetfulness, and difficulty thinking and understanding. Dementia, on the other hand, is a term that
                describes a group of symptoms associated with a decline in memory and can negatively affect other skills
                and abilities. It can be caused by Alzheimer’s, strokes, abnormal clumps of protein, or damage in the
                frontal or temporal lobes. Symptoms are similar, including forgetfulness, limited social skills, and
                jumbled speech. The best way to prevent it is through a healthy lifestyle: get plenty of exercises, eat
                healthy food, and take care of your mental health.

              <p>The event began with an introduction for the children with music and small talk before the start of the
                presentation on pneumonia. We explained a general description, causes, and symptoms of Alzheimer’s
                disease and dementia, before moving into preventive measures and healthy lifestyle changes. We concluded
                with a Q&A session.

              <p>We thought the best way to explain a memory disease is to demonstrate the power of memory and teach the
                youth ways to keep their brain healthy and engaged. We had four stations for four different games: Magic
                cup, Number string, Spot the difference, and Jenga building. In Magic cup, the players followed one of
                our members as he moved the ball around among many cups, similar to the famous magic trick. For Number
                string, we went around in a circle asking everyone to randomly say numbers to create a number ‘string,’
                and every successive person had to restate all of the past numbers before adding his or her own number.
                At Spot the Difference, the players had to identify 5 differences between two almost identical pictures.
                At Jenga building, the players tried to recreate one of our Jenga structures completely from memory
                after they looked at the design for 15 seconds

              <p>We created a variation of Memory Matching to teach the youth about Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.
                Each memory matching card consisted of a symbol related to the two diseases; these symbols included
                proper sleep, diet, serotonin, dopamine, and the cerebral cortex, among many others. The children
                competed against each other at their table, and whoever matched the most pairs won. However, the twist
                was that every time a person matched a pair, they had to answer one of our review multiple-choice
                questions based on the presentation so that we could reinforce the lessons we taught
