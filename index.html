        Take tooth decay. Everyone knows about cavities and how important
        going to the dentist is. Right? How many people know that tooth decay
        is the most prevalent childhood disease, according to the American
        Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD)? How many children know that
        even some healthy foods packed with carbohydrates, like bagels and
        granola bars, are potentially just as harmful for your teeth as sugary
        foods? How about this shocker: you miss cleaning 40% of your tooth
        surfaces if you don’t floss. Either most of us do not know or do not
        appreciate the importance of flossing, because according to a recent
        health survey, only 30% of the United States population flosses daily.

        At One Step Ahead, we aspire to teach children about the importance of
        healthy by making them understand how to stay healthy. Ideas never
        stick unless they are understood. In our events, presnetaions, and
        games, we discuss how our human body works, the different functions of
        our organs and body parts, the best ways to stay healthy and active,
        and most importantly, diseases that are under-discussed in our
        soceity, like tooth decay.

          Our campaign revolves around letting people know. Be it through
          detailed presentations, answering curious questions, or passing our
          knowledge through simple conversation, we aim to give the children
          all the facts so they understand why and how to be healthy.

        <p class="pillar-text">
          The best way to deal with disease is to prevent ever being infected
          by diseases. By The time one becomes infected, the damage is already
          done. We always include a prevention component in our presentations
          and games, and we encourage children to stay healthy by exercising,
          having a balanced diet, and other related measures.

        <p class="pillar-text">
          We can provide as much information as we want, but if the children
          ultimately are disengaged, the information will go through one ear
          and out the other. We always try to keep the kids interested by
          encouraging questions, creating new and creative games ourselves for
          each and every event, and by simply getting to know the children we
          teach on a closer level.
